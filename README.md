# Overview

This is a simple project that renders a single orange triangle to the screen. It is the starting-point of most OpenGL projects; before you can render models you have to be able to render a single triangle.

This software's purpose was an exercise in a few things. Firstly, it was to practice my ability to remember all of the steps to render the triangle, and secondly it served for me to see how quickly and efficiently I could carry out this task.
